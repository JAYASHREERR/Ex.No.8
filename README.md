## Exp 8: Reproducing an Image Using Prompts for Image Generation

# Date : 23.10.2025
# Reg. No. 212222060090


## Aim:

To demonstrate the ability of text-to-image generation tools to reproduce an existing image by crafting precise prompts. The goal is to identify key elements within the image and use these details to generate an image as close as possible to the original.

## Tools / LLMs Used:

Tool: DALL·E (by OpenAI)

Model Type: Text-to-Image Generation

Website: https://openai.com/dall-e

## Procedure:

Analyzed the Given Image:
Observed the image to identify key elements such as:

Objects/Subjects: Mountains, sunrise, lake, forest.

Colors: Warm golden and orange hues with soft shadows.

Textures: Smooth lake reflection, rugged mountain surfaces.

Lighting: Early morning sunlight with glowing rays.

Background: Mountain range with clear sky and reflective water.

Composition: Centered sunrise, symmetrical reflection.

Style: Realistic landscape photography.

Created the Basic Prompt:
“A sunrise over mountains with reflections on a lake.”

Refined the Prompt with More Detail:
“A warm sunrise over snowless mountains with golden light rays reflecting clearly on a calm lake surrounded by forests.”

Added Style and Lighting Details:
“A realistic photograph of a sunrise over mountains with warm light rays and clear reflections on a lake.”

Generated Image Using DALL·E:
Used the refined prompt to create the final image.

Compared Original and Generated Images:

The generated image closely matched the real one in composition and color tone.

Reflection clarity and sunlight rays were accurately captured.

Minor variation in mountain texture and tree density.

## Prompts Used:

Final Refined Prompt:

“A realistic photograph of a sunrise over mountains with warm light rays and clear reflections on a lake.”

## Generated Output Image:

<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0693ad5d-690b-4aca-8704-562a1cccbd14" />


## Comparison Report:
Feature	Original Image	Generated Image	Remarks
Lighting	Warm sunrise glow	Accurately reproduced	Perfect match
Reflections	Clear lake reflections	Very similar	High similarity
Color Tone	Golden orange hues	Slightly deeper tones	Acceptable variation
Composition	Central sunrise focus	Nearly identical	Good alignment
Detail Level	Real-world photo	Realistic rendering	Excellent result

## Conclusion:

By using detailed and descriptive prompts, DALL·E successfully reproduced a realistic version of the original image. The experiment demonstrates that accurate prompt crafting and iterative refinement significantly enhance the quality and closeness of AI-generated images to real-world visuals. This technique is valuable in design, art, and creative content generation.
